#  Delivery App – Laravel REST API Backend

A RESTful API backend for a delivery application, built using **Laravel**. This API allows users to browse products by category and store, manage their profiles, place and edit orders, maintain a favorites list, and verify their account via OTP email using **Gmail SMTP**.    
Laravel Sanctum is used for secure token-based authentication,
and the system also supports **Redis** queues for handling background jobs (like OTP emails and notifications) and **Laravel Horizon** for monitoring and managing queued jobs.

## 🖼️ Image Note

📷 **Product**, **Store**, and **User** images are **not included** in this repository.

The seeded data references image files located under:

- `storage/product_photos/`
- `storage/profile_photos/`
- `storage/store_photos/`

If these image files are missing, the application will automatically display a **placeholder image** using a public service such as [https://placehold.co].
